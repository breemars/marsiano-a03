    Password Generator
    - input minimum length, special char count, and number count
    - use a separate class to store methods as this is a long program that belongs in object-format
    -- it will be more organized/easier to set the char arrays and call the calculations from a separate class
    - create 3 lists of possible letters, numbers, and special chars
    - while password incomplete:
    -- generate a random number for type of char going to be inserted
    -- generate another random number to pick from that type of list
    -- insert that char into a final char list for the final password
    - return the final password and print
